Here is a <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Hyderabad#Get_in">handy Wiki page</a> describing about the various ways you can travel to Hyderabad. The main points have been highlighted below.</p><h2 id="by-plane---rajiv-gandhi-international-airport">By Plane - Rajiv Gandhi International Airport</h2><h4 id="to-hyderabad">To Hyderabad:</h4><p>Domestic connectivity to Hyderabad is excellent with major Indian airlines such as Air India, Indigo Airlines, Jet Airways, Trujet and SpiceJet.</p><p><strong>From the Airport to the Venue:</strong> Once you arrive at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, one option is to take the air-conditioned buses run by the airport (Pushpak) to Gachibowli (Near Outer-Ring-Road(ORR)). It will cost approx. 250 INR. The buses have a frequency of every 30 min from 3:30AM-12AM and every hour at midnight, 1AM, 2AM and 3AM. The travel time varying from 45 mins to 2 hrs depending on time of the day and traffic conditions. <a href="http://www.hyderabad.aero/to-from-airport.aspx">Here are the timings of various buses from the airport</a>. Take a bus from <strong>RGIA TO Gachibowli</strong>. You can reach the designated points and then take an auto or metered cab from there to reach the venue.</p><p>Alternatively, you can hire metered air-conditioned radio cabs. Skycabs and Meru are approved by the airport itself @ 21 INR/km and are available just after exiting the terminal building. For the rest, you need to call and book with a lead time of 15 minutes to 1 hour. These cabs charge 25% surcharge in the night (ie, between 23:00 hours and 05:00 hours). Hyderabad traffic police counter is on the ground floor with prepaid taxis.</p><p><strong>Beware of taxi soliciting tours at the airport greeting area; they might try to scam you into paying exorbitant rates (especially so in case of non-locals)</strong>. The Hyderabad Traffic Police has partnered with the Airport authorities to run a counter for prepaid taxis. This is a safe option as all taxis are registered with the police. The police also runs a <strong>SHE cab service</strong> now, especially for women travellers, with female drivers and safety equipment such as a GPS connected to the Police Control Room.</p><p>One can also hire a cab from many app-based services such as <strong>Uber</strong> or <strong>Ola</strong> directly to the Venue which are readily available in Hyderabad.</p><p>If 3-4 of you are travelling together, then it is possible to directly take a cab as it will be cheaper (Please keep in mind that while these services are substantially cheaper than the radio cabs, they will charge Rs. 200 in addition to the fare as parking charges levied on them by the airport). This option is the best while travelling to the airport, as the parking charges do not apply for departures.</p><p>Hired cars are also available from a booth just before walking outside of the airport. This gives you the advantage of paying in advance, thereby avoiding any disagreements over price. The airport can be contacted on their (toll free for BSNL/MTNL subscribers) number 1 800 419-2008 for all services and inquiries including arrivals/departure information, facilities, transport availability, etc.</p><h2 id="by-train---secundrabad-or-hyderabad">By Train - Secundrabad or Hyderabad</h2><h4 id="to-hyderabad-1">To Hyderabad:</h4><p>Indian Railways has service to Hyderabad from all over India.
